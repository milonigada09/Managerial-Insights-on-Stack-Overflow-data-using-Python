Project Overview

For almost a decade, Stack Overflow’s annual Developer Survey held the honor of being the largest survey of people who code around the world. 
This year, rather than aiming to be the biggest, they set out to make the survey more representative of the diversity of programmers worldwide. 
That said, the survey is still big. This year’s survey was taken by nearly 65,000 people.!

In this Project, I cleaned rogue data (Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey, 2020) with various cleaning techniques and used ML algorithms to draw relation between users’ income/gender/age/education, corroborated insights that tracked the journey of a user through the website and their platform usage to boost operations and increase profit for organization
